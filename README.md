# Super Lightweight Nginx Image

`docker run -v /path/to/serve:/static -p 8080:80 flashspys/nginx-static`

This command exposes an nginx server on port 8080 which serves the folder `/path/to/serve` from the host.

The image can only be used for static file serving but has with **less than 4 MB** roughly 1/10 the size of the official nginx image. The running container needs **~1 MB RAM**.

### nginx-static via HTTPS

To serve your static files over HTTPS you must use another reverse proxy. We recommend [træfik](https://traefik.io/) as a lightweight reverse proxy with docker integration. Do not even try to get HTTPS working with this image only, as it does not contain the nginx ssl module.

### nginx-static with docker-compose
This is an example entry for a `docker-compose.yaml`
```
version: '3'
services:
  example.org:
    image: flashspys/nginx-static
    container_name: example.org
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes: 
      - /path/to/serve:/static
```


### nginx-static with træfik 2.0

To use nginx-static with træfik 2.0 add an entry to your services in a docker-compose.yaml. To set up traefik look at this [simple example](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guides/docker-compose/basic-example/). 

In the following example, replace everything contained in <angle brackets> and the domain with your values.

```
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:2.0
  # Your treafik config.
    ...
  example.org:
    image: flashspys/nginx-static
    container_name: example.org
    networks:
      - web
    expose:
      - 80
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.<router>.rule=Host(`example.org`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.<router>.entrypoints=<entrypoint>"
# If you want to enable SSL, uncomment the following line.
#      - "traefik.http.routers.<router>.tls.certresolver=<certresolver>"
    volumes: 
      - /host/path/to/serve:/static
```

For a traefik 1.7 example look [at an old version of the readme](https://github.com/flashspys/docker-nginx-static/blob/bb46250b032d187cab6029a84335099cc9b4cb0e/README.md)

### nginx-static for multi-stage builds

nginx-static is also suitable for multi-stage builds. This is an example Dockerfile for a static nodejs application:

```
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN npm install && npm run build

FROM flashspys/nginx-static
RUN apk update && apk upgrade
COPY --from=0 /usr/src/app/dist /static
```
